# Indoor Cultivation Partnership Program

## Zero Investment Solar + Automated Growing

**A unique partnership where you earn €4,800 - €7,200 per year with zero upfront cost.**

- **Free solar energy system**
- **Fully automated grow setup**
- **Complete management service**
- **Guaranteed yield-sharing income**

**You provide the space. We provide everything else. We split the harvest 50/50.**

---

## The Economics

### Production Capacity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Plants | 4 (Malta legal maximum) |
| Harvest Cycle | Every 2 months |
| Harvests per Year | 6 |
| Yield per Harvest | 200-300 grams |
| Market Value | €8 per gram |

### Your Annual Income

| Scenario | Per Harvest | Annual Total |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Minimum** (200g) | €800 (your 50%) | €4,800 |
| **Average** (250g) | €1,000 (your 50%) | €6,000 |
| **Maximum** (300g) | €1,200 (your 50%) | €7,200 |

### Additional Benefits

**Free Solar Power for Your Home**

The 6 kWp system produces ~25 kWh per day. The grow operation uses ~12 kWh.

**Remaining for your home: ~13 kWh daily = €700-900/year in electricity savings**

**Total Annual Value to You:**
- Cannabis share: €4,800 - €7,200
