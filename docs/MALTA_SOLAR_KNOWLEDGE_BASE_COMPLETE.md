## Executive Summary - The Real Story

### What They Tell You
- Government grants up to €10,200 make solar affordable
- Feed-in tariffs guarantee income for 20 years
- Solar is a great investment for everyone

### What's Actually Happening
- Grant approval takes 6-9 months + 2-3 months installation = **8-12 months total wait**
- Installation costs are inflated when grants are involved
- Without grants, installations would be CHEAPER and FASTER
- The €0.105/kWh tariff with grant vs €0.15/kWh without grant creates a massive long-term difference
- Most companies push grants because it's easier to market, not because it's better for you

---

## Grant Schemes - How They Actually Work

### Official Grant Amounts (2025)

#### PV Systems
- **PV system with standard inverter**: 50% of eligible costs, up to €2,500 per system (€625/kWp)
- **PV system with hybrid inverter**: 50% of eligible costs, up to €3,000 per system (€750/kWp)

#### Battery Storage
- **Hybrid inverter + battery storage**:
  - 80% of battery costs, up to €7,200 (€720/kWh)
  - 80% of hybrid inverter costs, up to €1,800 (€450/kWp)
- **Battery storage only**: 80% of battery costs, up to €7,200 (€720/kWh)

#### Maximum Possible Grants
- **Malta**: Up to €10,200 total
- **Gozo**: Up to €11,550 total (95% coverage for battery systems)

### The Price Inflation Problem

**Critical Insight**: Installation prices are artificially inflated when grants are involved.

Example for 6.5 kW system:
- **WITH grant market price**: €7,500-8,000
- **WITHOUT grant (real cost)**: €3,500-4,500
- **The difference**: €3,500-4,000 markup because "the government is paying"

This means:
- The grant doesn't save you as much as it appears
- Installers maximize the grant amount by inflating prices
- You're still paying more than you should, even after the grant

## Feed-in Tariff Rates

### The Two-Tier System

#### Tier 1: WITHOUT Grant (Premium Rate)
- **Rate**: €0.15 per kWh
- **Duration**: 20 years guaranteed
- **Eligibility**: No government grant or subsidy taken
- **Cap**: Systems up to 40 kWp

#### Tier 2: WITH Grant (Reduced Rate)
- **Rate**: €0.105 per kWh
- **Duration**: 20 years guaranteed
- **Eligibility**: Received any government grant
- **Penalty**: 30% lower rate for entire system lifetime

### The Mathematical Reality

For a 6.5 kW system producing 11,700 kWh/year:
- **Without grant**: 11,700 × €0.15 = €1,755/year × 20 years = €35,100
- **With grant**: 11,700 × €0.105 = €1,228/year × 20 years = €24,560
- **Difference**: €10,540 less income over 20 years

## The Hidden Timeline Problem

### What Nobody Tells You About Grant Timelines

#### Official Process (What They Say)
- "Streamlined application process"
- "Instant approval for Part A applications"
- "Applications open February 26, 2025"

#### Reality (What Actually Happens)
1. **Application submission**: 1-2 weeks to prepare documents
2. **REWS review and approval**: 6-9 months waiting
3. **Installation scheduling**: 2-3 months after approval
4. **Total time to generation**: 8-12 months minimum

#### No-Grant Timeline
1. **Contact installer**: Day 1
2. **Site visit and quote**: Week 1
3. **Sign contract**: Week 1-2
4. **Installation**: Week 2-3
5. **Grid connection**: Same day as installation
6. **Generating power**: 14-21 days total

### The Cost of Waiting

**10 months of waiting means:**
- 10 months paying full electricity bills
- 10 months of missed generation (9,750 kWh for 6.5kW system)
- €1,463 of missed income (at no-grant rate)
- Lost compound effect over 20 years

## Price Manipulation by Industry

### How the Grant System Inflates Prices

#### Standard Industry Practice
1. **Customer asks about solar**
2. **Company asks: "Will you use the grant?"**
3. **If YES**: Quote inflated to maximize grant utilization
4. **If NO**: Quote real market price

#### Real Price Examples (6.5 kW system)

**When applying for grant:**
- Quoted price: €7,500-8,000
- Grant covers: €3,000 (hybrid inverter system)
- Customer pays: €4,500-5,000
- **Actual value**: €3,500-4,000

**Without grant:**
- Quoted price: €3,500-4,500
- Customer pays: €3,500-4,500
- **Same system, different price**

### Why This Happens
- Companies know the government is paying
- Customers don't comparison shop (think they're getting a "deal")
- REWS doesn't audit if prices are fair market value
- Industry collusion to maintain high "grant prices"

## Grant vs No Grant - Real Comparison

### Scenario 1: WITH GRANT

**Year 0-1:**
- Apply for grant: January
- Approval: July-October (6-9 months)
- Installation: October-January (2-3 more months)
- Total wait: 8-12 months
- Generation in Year 1: 0-2 months worth

**Financials:**
- System cost (inflated): €7,500
- Grant received: €3,000
- You pay: €4,500
- Feed-in tariff: €0.105/kWh (for 20 years)
- Annual income: €1,228
- 20-year total income: €24,560
- Net profit: €20,060

**Payback period**: 3.7 years (after it finally starts generating)

### Scenario 2: WITHOUT GRANT

**Year 0-1:**
- Contact installer: January
- Installation: January (2-3 weeks)
- Generating: February onwards
- Generation in Year 1: 11 months worth

**Financials:**
- System cost (real price): €3,500
- You pay: €3,500
- Feed-in tariff: €0.15/kWh (for 20 years)
- Annual income: €1,755
- 20-year total income: €35,100
- Net profit: €31,600

**Payback period**: 2.0 years

### The Bottom Line
- **No-grant path**: €11,540 MORE profit over 20 years
- **Plus**: Generating 10 months earlier
- **Plus**: Paying real prices, not inflated ones

## Frequently Asked Questions - Honest Answers

### Q1: Why do all companies push the grant option?
**A:** Three reasons:
1. Easier to market ("Government pays 50%!")
2. Higher profit margins on inflated prices
3. Customers don't know about the timeline issues

### Q2: Is the 6-9 month wait documented anywhere?
**A:** No. Official sources say "streamlined process" but reality from actual applicants is 6-9 months for approval plus 2-3 months for installation.

### Q3: Can I switch from grant to no-grant after applying?
**A:** Yes, but you lose your place in queue. Better to decide upfront.

### Q4: Why are prices lower without grants?
**A:** Market competition. Without grant inflation, companies must offer real prices to compete. With grants, everyone inflates together.

### Q5: What if I can't afford €3,500 upfront?
**A:** Options:
- 0.5% interest financing for 3 years available
- Some installers offer payment plans
- Grant might be only option despite disadvantages

### Q6: Will feed-in tariffs change?
**A:** Current rates guaranteed for 20 years once you sign up. Future applicants might get different rates.

### Q7: What about battery storage?
**A:**
- With grant: 80% covered, but same waiting issues
- Without grant: Add €2,000-3,000 for 5-10 kWh
- ROI: 3-5 years typically

### Q8: Which installers are honest about this?
**A:** Few will volunteer this information. Ask directly:
- "What's your price without grant?"
- "How long is the real wait for grant approval?"
- "Can I see installs you did without grants?"

### Q9: Is going without grant legal?
**A:** Absolutely. It's your choice. You're just choosing the higher FIT rate over the subsidy.

### Q10: What's the catch with no-grant?
**A:** No catch. Just need the upfront capital. If you have it, the math is clear.

## Industry Secrets

### What Solar Companies Don't Want You to Know

1. **The Quote Game**
   - First quote always assumes grant (higher price)
   - "Special discount" if you go no-grant is actually the real price
   - Multiple companies collude on grant pricing

2. **The Waiting List Myth**
   - "We're booking for October" (it's January)
   - Creates urgency to sign up
   - No-grant installs can happen in 2 weeks

3. **The Complexity Illusion**
   - "It's too complicated without the grant"
   - Reality: No-grant is SIMPLER (less paperwork)

4. **The Hidden Costs**
   - "Grant covers everything"
   - Reality: You still pay €4,500+ after grant
   - Without grant: €3,500 total

5. **The Tariff Truth**
   - Rarely mention the 30% tariff reduction with grant
   - Focus on "government pays" not long-term income

---

## Decision Framework

### Choose GRANT If:
- You absolutely cannot access €3,500-4,000
- You're moving in 5-10 years (won't see full benefit)
- You don't mind waiting 8-12 months
- You value lower upfront cost over total return

### Choose NO-GRANT If:
- You have access to €3,500+ (cash or financing)
- You want to maximize 20-year returns
- You want to start generating immediately
- You understand the math favors this option

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Installer won't give no-grant price
- "Grant is always better" claims
- No discussion of tariff differences
- Pressure to "lock in grant funding"

## Action Steps

### If You Want to Proceed:

1. **Get Both Quotes**
   - Ask every installer for WITH and WITHOUT grant prices
   - Get it in writing
   - Compare the spread (it reveals the inflation)

2. **Calculate YOUR Numbers**
   - Your roof size → system size
   - System size × 1,800 = annual kWh
   - Annual kWh × €0.15 = no-grant annual income
   - Annual kWh × €0.105 = grant annual income

3. **Consider Timing**
   - Can you wait 8-12 months?
   - What's your electricity bill during waiting?
   - Summer peak generation months?

4. **Make Informed Decision**
   - Don't let companies decide for you
   - The math usually favors no-grant
   - But your situation might be different
