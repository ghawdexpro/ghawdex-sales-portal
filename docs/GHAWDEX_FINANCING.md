# Why Finance Your Solar?

## The Smart Approach

Even if you have cash available, financing can make sense:

| Factor | Cash Purchase | BOV Loan (0.5%) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Upfront Cost** | Full amount | €0 - minimal |
| **Cash Preserved** | None | For other investments |
| **Interest Cost** | €0 | Very low (0.5% first 3 years) |
| **Solar Income** | Immediate | Covers payments + profit |

### Example: 6 kWp System (€4,500)

**Cash Purchase:**
- Pay €4,500 today
- Earn €1,620/year
- Break even: 2.8 years

**BOV Loan (10 years):**
- Pay ~€40/month
- Earn €135/month from solar
- **Net profit from month 1: ~€95/month**
- Total interest paid: ~€300 over 10 years
- You keep €4,500 cash for other uses

**The solar income pays the loan AND gives you profit from day one.**
