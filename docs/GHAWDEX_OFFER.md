# Why Go Solar in Malta?

Malta is one of the best places in Europe for solar energy:

- **2,400+ sunshine hours** per year
- **5.2 kWh/m² daily** solar irradiance
- **300+ sunny days** annually
- **Government support** with feed-in tariffs guaranteed for 20 years

Every day without solar panels, you're paying for electricity you could be generating for free - and earning income from.

# How Solar Works in Malta

## The Feed-in Tariff System

When you install solar panels in Malta, you connect to the national grid and enter a **Feed-in Tariff (FIT)** agreement:

1. **Your panels generate electricity** during daylight hours
2. **You use what you need** in your home first
3. **Excess electricity exports** to the grid
4. **Enemalta pays you** for every kWh you export
5. **Rates are guaranteed** for 20 years

## Two Paths to Solar

### Path 1: With Government Grant

**How it works:**
- Apply through REWS for a government grant
- Receive up to €10,200 (Malta) or €11,550 (Gozo)
- Wait 8-12 months for approval
- Lower feed-in tariff: **€0.105/kWh**

**Grant Eligibility:**
- Malta: ~80% of applicants eligible
- Gozo: ~95% of applicants eligible (higher rates)
- Must be for on-grid installation
- Can add battery later if you took PV grant before

### Path 2: Without Government Grant

**How it works:**
- No application, no waiting
- Install in 2-3 weeks
- Higher feed-in tariff: **€0.15/kWh** (43% more!)
- Lower installation cost (no inflated "grant pricing")

# The Grant Truth: An Honest Comparison

We believe in transparency. Here's the real math on a **6.5 kWp system**:

## 20-Year Financial Comparison

| Factor | With Grant | Without Grant |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Installation Price** | €7,500 (inflated) | €4,500 (real cost) |
| **Grant Received** | €3,000 | €0 |
| **Your Investment** | €4,500 | €4,500 |
| **Feed-in Tariff** | €0.105/kWh | €0.15/kWh |
| **Annual Income** | €1,228 | €1,755 |
| **Waiting Time** | 8-12 months | 2-3 weeks |
| **20-Year Income** | €24,560 | €35,100 |
| **20-Year Profit** | €20,060 | €31,600 |

**The Difference: €11,540 more profit without grant**

### Why the Difference?

1. **Tariff Penalty**: The grant locks you into a 30% lower rate for 20 years
2. **Price Inflation**: Industry inflates prices when grants are involved
3. **Lost Generation**: 10 months of waiting = €1,400+ in missed income
4. **Faster Payback**: 2 years without grant vs 4-5 years with grant

### Which Should You Choose?

**Consider the Grant if:**
- You have limited upfront capital
- Cash flow is more important than total profit
- You're okay waiting 8-12 months

**Consider No Grant if:**
- You want maximum long-term profit
- You can invest the full amount upfront
- You want solar generating within weeks
- BOV financing at 0.5% interest works for you

**We present both options honestly - you choose what's best for your situation.**

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long do solar panels last?**
A: 25-30+ years with minimal degradation (0.5% per year). After 25 years, panels still produce 80-90% of original capacity.

**Q: Will panels work on cloudy days?**
A: Yes, though at reduced capacity (10-25%). Malta's climate means this is rare - we have 300+ sunny days per year.

**Q: Do I need batteries?**
A: Not required, but recommended for energy independence and maximizing self-consumption. Batteries store excess solar for night use.

**Q: What happens during a power outage?**
A: Standard grid-tied systems shut off for safety. With battery + EMS, you can have backup power.

**Q: Can I expand my system later?**
A: Yes! We design with expansion in mind. Add panels, battery, or EMS anytime.

**Q: What maintenance is needed?**
A: Minimal - panel cleaning 2-4 times per year (we offer this service) and annual inspection.

**Q: Will this affect my roof warranty?**
A: Our installation methods preserve roof warranties. We provide a 10-year waterproofing guarantee.
