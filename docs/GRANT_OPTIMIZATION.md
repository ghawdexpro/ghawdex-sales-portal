# Grant Optimization Strategy

## The Dilemma: Low Prices vs Maximum Grant

There's an inherent tradeoff between showing customers a large grant amount vs giving them the best actual deal.

## How Grant Caps Work (Malta - REWS 2025)

| Component | Grant Rate | Per-Unit Cap | Max Grant |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| PV System | 50% of price | €750/kWp | €3,000 |
| Battery | 80% of price | €720/kWh | €7,200 |
| **Total Max** | | | **€10,200** |

## Example: 5kWp + 10kWh Battery

### Current Pricing (Customer-Optimized)

| Component | Price | Grant (rate) | Grant Received |
|-----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 5kWp PV | €2,000 | 50% | €1,000 |
| 10kWh Battery | €7,500 | 80% | €6,000 |
| **Total** | **€9,500** | | **€7,000** |

**Customer pays: €9,500 - €7,000 = €2,500 net**

### Max Grant Pricing (Grant-Optimized)

| Component | Price | Grant (rate) | Grant Received |
|-----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 5kWp PV | €6,000 | 50% | €3,000 (maxed) |
| 10kWh Battery | €9,000 | 80% | €7,200 (maxed) |
| **Total** | **€15,000** | | **€10,200** |

**Customer pays: €15,000 - €10,200 = €4,800 net**

## Decision: Keep Current Low Pricing

**Rationale:**
- Customer net cost is €2,500 vs €4,800 - almost 2x difference
- Lower prices = better actual value for customer
- Showing "€10,200 grant" looks impressive but customer pays more
- Trust and value > marketing optics

## When to Reconsider

- If competitors advertise "€10,200 grant" and win deals
- If customers specifically ask "why isn't my grant €10,200?"
- If REWS changes grant percentages or caps

## Grant Utilization by System

| System + Battery | Current Grant | Max Possible | Utilization |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 3kWp + 5kWh | ~€3,950 | €5,760 | 69% |
| 5kWp + 10kWh | €7,000 | €10,200 | 69% |
| 10kWp + 10kWh | €9,000 | €10,200 | 88% |
| 15kWp + 15kWh | €10,200 | €10,200 | 100% |

**Note:** Larger systems naturally max out the grant because the prices are higher.
