## BATTERY STORAGE

All batteries: LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) - safest technology, 6,000+ cycles, 10-year warranty.

| Battery | Price | Best Paired With | Self-Consumption Increase |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 5 kWh | €5,000 | 5-6 kWp | +20-30% |
| 10 kWh | €10,000 | 8-12 kWp | +35-45% |
| 15 kWh | €15,000 | 12-15 kWp | +45-55% |

**Why LFP?**
- Cannot catch fire (unlike standard lithium)
- Stable in Malta's hot climate
- 6,000+ cycles vs 3,000-4,000 for standard lithium

## BATTERY-ONLY OPTION (No Solar Required)

Customers can purchase battery storage **without solar panels** and still receive grants!

### Battery-Only Grant Rates

| Location | Grant % | Max Grant | Customer Pays (10kWh) |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Malta | 80% | €7,200 | €1,500 |
| **Gozo** | **95%** | **€8,550** | **€375** |

### Who Should Consider Battery-Only?

1. **Existing solar owners** - Add battery to store excess production
2. **High electricity consumers** - Save by charging at night
3. **Future solar planners** - Get battery now, add solar later
4. **Gozo residents** - 95% grant = incredible value!

### Customer Cost Examples (GhawdeX Pricing)

| Battery | Price | Malta Grant | Malta Pays | Gozo Grant | Gozo Pays |
|---------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 5 kWh | €4,000 | €3,200 | **€800** | €3,600 | **€400** |

### Battery-Only Savings (Without Solar)

Batteries save money through tariff arbitrage:
- Charge at cheapest rate times
- Use stored power during expensive peak hours
- **Annual savings: €300-900** depending on consumption

### Key Selling Points

> "In Gozo, you can get a €7,500 battery for just €375 - the government covers 95%!"

> "Already have solar? Add a battery for just €1,500 and store your excess production."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Too expensive"
"With BOV financing at 0.5%, your monthly payment is always less than your solar income. You profit from day one. No upfront cost required."

### "Worried about quality with fast installation"
"Our 14-day guarantee comes from 30+ years of offshore engineering experience - we're efficient, not rushed. 2000+ installations with this timeline."

### "Should I wait for better technology?"
"Solar panel efficiency improvements are incremental (0.5%/year). Waiting means losing years of income. Today's panels are already excellent and will produce for 25+ years."

### "What about cloudy days?"
"Malta has 2,400+ sunshine hours annually - more than most of Europe. Your system produces all year round, and you're connected to the grid for backup."

### "What if I sell my house?"
"Solar increases property value. Buyers pay premium for homes with guaranteed €3,000+/year income. It's an investment, not an expense."

### "Grant vs no grant?"
"No grant = higher tariff (€0.15 vs €0.105) = faster payback (2.8 vs 4 years). Both options are profitable. We recommend no-grant path for maximum ROI."

3. **Educate:** Explain how feed-in works - sell ALL production to grid at fixed rate
4. **Recommend:** Match system size to their situation
5. **Address concerns:** Handle objections with facts
6. **Next step:** Offer free detailed analysis or site visit
